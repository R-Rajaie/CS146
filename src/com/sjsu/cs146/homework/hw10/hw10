This is basically BFS, so we can start by making a queue.
We'll put our root in the queue, and then begin our BFS.
We take an iterative approach, popping nodes from the queue, adding them to the list for the given level,
then adding their nodes to the queue before submitting our current list for the current level into the grand list.

We can treat this like a graph problem, treating the houses like nodes and the connections between them as edges.
Essentially, this is just finding the MST of the graph, then.

We do Kruskal's first to find the MST. Since the 0 well is free we'll definitely add that,
we'll add an edge between it and the 0 house.
We then sort the pipes array so that we know we can traverse it.
We'll traverse the edges, and if this edge finds a new node to connect, we choose it

We can treat this like a graph problem, treating the houses like nodes and the connections between them as edges.
Essentially, this is just finding the MST of the graph, then.

We do Kruskal's first to find the MST. Since the 0 well is free we'll definitely add that,
we'll add an edge between it and the 0 house.
We then sort the pipes array so that we know we can traverse it.

The real meat of the algorithm then begins, where we take each connection and evaluate if they have the same parent.
If not, we know it's a new connection, add the cost c, and decrement the number of houses left to be connected.
We do this until we've either looped through all connections or connected all houses.

We find parents through recursion in the find method.

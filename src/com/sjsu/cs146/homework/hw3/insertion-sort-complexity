A quick summary of insertion sort is (assuming a worst case):
n       for second index to length of array
n - 1       do stuff
n (n - 1)   while the current index hasn't been sorted
(n - 1) (n - 1) sort current index

While there are some parts of the specific pseudocode I left out,
this representation accurately shows that it will eventually become a
polynomial of form ax^2 + bx + c (because of the (n - 1) (n - 1)),
meaning that it is an equation of the second exponent.
This means that it can be simplified to an equation of form ax^2 which will effectively
be an equation of time complexity n^2

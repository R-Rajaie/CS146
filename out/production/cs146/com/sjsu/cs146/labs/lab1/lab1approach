For testing purposes, I create a loop that goes through an array of [1,2,3,4,5] to evaluate a target integer of 0 through 10.
There are probably better arrays that cover more cases and have only 1 answer per target but I am confident the algorithm is correct :]

First, we create a hashmap. We loop thru our array and populate this hashmap with the key representing the values in the array
and values representing their indexes in the array.
As we do this, we ask if there exists a key that is equal to the target minus the key we just added. This is the current keys 'counterpart'
If this exists (and we ensure that we're not using the same element), we know we have the two numbers needed, so we retrieve
their indexes and return those.

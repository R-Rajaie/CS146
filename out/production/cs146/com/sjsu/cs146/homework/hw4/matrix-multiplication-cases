Best, Worst, Average: Matrix multiplication (at least in the way shown to be implemented) will never really change
in speed depending on what is inside the matrix. This means that two matrix multiplication operations will roughly
take the same time (given that the data types are the same).
This means that our n^3 approximation from the last assignment can be lifted and stuffed into a Theta. We can use
theta since matrix multiplication is very tightly bounded. We can make the best, worst, and average case the same
because of the aforementioned reasons too. This means that our final answer for all three is Theta(n^3).

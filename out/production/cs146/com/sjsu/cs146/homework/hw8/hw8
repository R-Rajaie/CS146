We don't need to actually construct the palindrome, so as long as we know the ingredients that go into making a palindrome,
we can figure it from there.

Thankfully, we know! A palindrome has an even number of all letters, but it can have ONE letter with odd numbered
occurrences. This means that we essentially just need to find the total number of letters (ie, the longest possible
palindrome), then subtract the number of odd letters (in order to "make them even"), then add back in 1 to compensate
for our allotted single odd letter if we had odd letters.

Thankfully, we know if we need to add 1 back if we have already decreased the palindrome amount at all (meaning that at
least one odd numbered letter was present and was adjusted for).
